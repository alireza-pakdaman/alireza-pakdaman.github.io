                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                
                    <p>As a citizen of Iran, I cannot remain indifferent to the suffering of my people under the oppressive government. I hope for a free and democratic Iran where everyone can live in peace and prosperity. I also stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine and their right to self-determination and a just peace. I believe in equality, justice, and happiness for all people regardless of their race, religion, or nationality.</p>
                    <p>One of the ways to achieve a better world is through caring for others and helping those in need. I believe that we have a responsibility to use our talents and resources to improve the lives of others and make the world a better place. Science is also a powerful tool that can help us understand the world and find solutions to many of the challenges we face. Therefore, I'm passionate about promoting education and scientific research that can benefit humanity.</p>
                    <p>As Albert Einstein once said, "The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it." We must not be afraid to speak up against injustice and work towards a better future for ourselves and future generations. Nikola Tesla also believed in the power of science to create a better world, saying "The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine." Ibn Sina, also known as Avicenna, believed in the importance of knowledge and education, stating "Knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind." Al-Farabi, a philosopher and scientist from the Islamic Golden Age, emphasized the value of wisdom and virtue, saying "The goal of the wise is not to reject all traditional values, but rather to understand and apply them in the best possible way." Rhazes, a renowned physician and philosopher from the Islamic Golden Age, believed in the power of medicine to heal the body and the soul, saying "Medicine is not only a science; it is also an art. It does not consist of compounding pills and plasters; it deals with the very processes of life, which must be understood before they may be guided."</p>
